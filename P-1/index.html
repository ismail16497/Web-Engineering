      <h2 class="proposal">License Plate Detection</h2>
      <div>
        <h4 class="headings4">Introduction:</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
          Object Detection is one of the most common applications in the field of computer vision. It is widely used in different industries such as medical imaging
          automobiles, police, and many others.
            We are going to create an object detection model, that would be able to
            ● Detect the License Plate in a car 
            ● Use its OCR to correctly classify the 
            ○ Character part of the License Plate
            ○ Digits Part of the License Plate
        </pre>
        <h4 class="headings4">Objectives</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
          To design a real-time web application, that will take in a car image(with license plate visible) and will
            ● Detect the License Plate (Draw a bounding box around the license plate)
            ● Output the License Number
          For multiple images, it will take the path of the folder (that contains the images of the cars) and will perform prediction on all the images in a batch
          for faster prediction, and store the results in either a database or a text file accordingly</pre
        >
        <h4 class="headings4">Problem Description</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
        <b>What is Automatic Detection:</b>
          Automatic Detection of Number plates is going to be software that will use
        stateof-the-art deep learning algorithms and classical computer vision techniques to detect the number plate(draw a bounding box around it) and classify the 
        plate number.
          It is going to have a web interface, which can be used by the companies/industries
          for fast predictions and will be connected to a database.
        <b>Why Automatic Detection:</b>
          Automatic Detection and classification of Cars Number Plate are going to be
          helpful in a number of cases especially for the safety and security of the city. This software can be used by POLICE departments to quickly judge
          if the car is stolen, or there are some anomalies with the drivers which need to be checked.</pre>
        <h4 class="headings4">Project Scope</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
      ● Users will be able to use our web interface to select a single image or folder of images containing images of car
      ● The user will be able to perform the prediction live in the browser.
      ● The results of the license plate detection will then be stored in a database or text file as per user requirements.
      ● Users will be able to see the detected number plate via the bounding box for further satisfaction
        We are going to use a development-based approach where will use the currently implemented algorithms to implement our idea.</pre
        >

        <h4 class="headings4">Brief Feasibility Study</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
        <b>i. Risks Involved:</b> Some of the risks include incorrect detection of the number plate and incorrect predictions by OCR which will be solved accordingly
        when in the development phase via A/B testing.
        <b>ii. Resource Requirement:</b> We would need some high-end GPUs with NVIDIA CUDA drivers and at least 12GB of RAM for faster model training and predictions.</pre>
        <h4 class="headings4">Solution Application Areas</h4>
        <pre class="paragrapgh1">
        Our application will mainly target the Safety and Security Department of a city, which can use our application
        for detecting the number plates, and any crimes associated with them.</pre
